===================

A project aimed to explain reinforcement learning in the most simplistic way every possible by training a 32px by 32px game of flappy bird using Q-learning through a script written purely in JavaScript.

The script ![`js/brain.js`](js/brain.js) is where the learning logic resides and has been documented heavily to explain the Q-learning alorigthm from scratch and how it can be applied in a real-time scenario.

With everything written solely in JS gives us the liberty to train and test the game in our browser itself which is made accessible here: http://nileshsah.github.io/reinforcement-learning-flappybird/

In an ideal scenario, the bird learns to operate upon a static non-changing environment in mere 25 trials of the game while for a randomized environment it might take up to 1000+ trials.
